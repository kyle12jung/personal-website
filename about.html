                    <p>Hello, my name is Hyun Woo Jung, and I usually go by Kyle. I am a junior at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about coding for social good and creating software that could positively impact the world.
                        My main areas of focus are full-stack web development and mobile development. I have solid experience especially, in React, React Native, and REST APIs, but I'm comfortable working on the backend as well, having used Express.js
                        and Flask at work and on personal projects. I also have some experience in NLP and computer vision, and I'm more than open to these roles. I'm the most fluent in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, but I can work with Java and
                        C++. My other strengths include communicating with my team members, leading projects, fast learning, and breaking down challenging problems with creativity and enthusiasm. </p>
